### Full Stack Developer 

With over 6 years of experience crafting apps that don’t crash on launch (mostly), I love building things for mobile, web, and iOS. My toolkit’s full, my coffee cup’s fuller, and my Git history? Let’s not talk about that.

- Passionate about creative coding and solving quirky problems
- A team player who actually enjoys meetings (weird, I know) 🤝
- Frequently seen coding at 2AM because... that bug won't fix itself

If you do too, we’re already friends. Hit up my [website](https://sahilsaleem.in) — it’s got fewer bugs than my old code.
